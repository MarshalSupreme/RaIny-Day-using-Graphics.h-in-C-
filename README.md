# RaIny-Day-using-Graphics.h-in-C-
This two C programs is for my 2nd semester OOPS class project;
First file - NORMALDA.C is the program for creating a static image of man with umbrella,hut and sun in background.
Second file - RAINYDAY.C is the program for animating the previous scene from "first file" such that the man with 
              umbrella moves along the ground and it rains continously, while the hut and sun stays still in background.
              When any key is pressed in the keyboard, the rain stops and the man also stops walking and a rainbow occurs slowly opposite to the sun.
              
First file is for my Digital Assignment-1
Second file is for my Digital Assignment-2
